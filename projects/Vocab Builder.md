#Vocab Builder
Vocab Builder helps you build and revise your vocabulary. Works great for GRE, CAT, CMAT, XAT, SAT, GMAT, etc

## Features

* Collection of around 4800 words
* Completely offline - no internet connection required.
* Customizable - Add your own words, edit existing words.
* Learning mode and revision mode.  

In revision mode, you swipe to reveal the word meaning.  
In learning mode, the meaning is automatically shown.  

* Tagging & Synonyms - A word can be tagged with multiple other words. It allows you to make your own grouping of words.
* Periodic Notification - A notification can be configured to appear periodically which will show you the word along with its meaning.
* The notification can be configured to show only the words you want to learn.


## Star Rating System
Vocab Builder is unique from other vocabulary building software in a way it employs flexible star rating system. It makes no assumption regarding your current level of vocabulary or the words you find easy/difficulty.   

Instead, it allows you to mark words in 3 different categories  

* Zero star
* Half Star
* Full star

It is up to you to give semantic meaning to the star.  

* For people with strong vocabulary, a star can be given to few words they have trouble learning.
* For people who are just beginning to learn words, a star can be given to words they have already learnt.

Notification system allows you to specify what star level words you want to be shown in notifications.
A statistics page give percentage of each of starred, half starred and un-starred words.
