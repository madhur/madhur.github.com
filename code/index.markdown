This page  contain links to most of the research and non-research
related programming I've done. Almost all of the programs are including the source code. If not, you can find them up on [this](https://github.com/madhur/CollegeCode) git repository. If you still cannot find, shoot me a mail and I'll be happy to help.

## VA2Offset ##
VA2Offset is a nifty utility to convert the virtual address seen under debuggers likesoftice,ollydbg etc to offsets of the file. Virtual address supplied can reside in any of the section or in header of the Portable Executable File. 

Currently the program supports only Portable Executable Files. 
I have tested this program on Win98/2000.
