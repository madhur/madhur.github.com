If you read books you must not miss [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com). Despite [recent criticism](https://onezero.medium.com/almost-everything-about-goodreads-is-broken-662e424244d5) I found its very useful in order to catalogue my books. I mostly purchase physical books from [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com)
and kindle books from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in)

One of the issue I found is that I keep on dabbling across these multiple sites to read user reviews. I recently saw this [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodreads-ratings-for-ama/fkkcefhhadenobhjnngfdahhlodolkjg?hl=en) which shows Goodreads reviews on amazon.

I got motivated to do the same for Flipkart. Hence, I came up with [Goodreads for Flipkart](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodreads-for-flipkart/fjjkbkjfdcfehnphamihbglmjoglpjee) chrome extension. This extension shows the Goodreads reviews right on Flipkart book page without having to navigate or click a button. Check out the screenshot below.

If you found it useful, do install or have any feedback, leave it on [product page](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/goodreads-for-flipkart)
