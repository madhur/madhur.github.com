[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) has been upgraded to 1.0.2 and in process I have also updated this blog to be compatible with Jekyll 1.0.2.

There are tons of new features included in the new release. Check out the changelog [here](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/History.markdown)

Good to see [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) referring my post of [Installing Jekyll on Windows]({% post_url 2011-09-01-runningjekyllwindows %})
