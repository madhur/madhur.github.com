Recently, there has been a new trend of smaller keyboards because they consume
lesser real estate.

These come in various form factors such as Tenkeyless (TKL), 60%, 65%, 80%, 96%
keyboards. 

100% - These are our regular full size keyboards. This one is my older and the
best in this category [Das Keyboard
Professional](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional/)

65% - These do not have function keys and neither the numpad. This one is [Ducky

TKL or 80% - Tenkeyless. They do not have numpad i.e. 10 keys less. One of the
best is [Ducky one 2 Skyline TKL](https://www.meckeys.com/shop/keyboard/80-keyboard/ducky-one-2-skyline-tkl/)

60% - Similar to 65%, but these get rid of arrow keys too. This is [Ducky one 2

96% - These essentially have all keys, but with compact design. Below is my
current [Keychron k4](https://keychron.in/product/keychron-k4-wireless-mechanical-keyboard/)

I too recently switched from [Das Keyboard Professional](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional/) to [Keycrhon k4](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k4-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)

Best resources for mechanical keyboards in India:


[Reddit - Mechanical Keyboards India](https://www.reddit.com/r/mkindia/) - A
place to discuss about mechanical keyboards in India

[Meckeys](https://www.meckeys.com/category/keyboard/) - Currently, the best
place to buy mechanical keyboards in India

[Keychron.in](https://keychron.in/) - You can order keychron keyboards in India
from here. Though they have been out of stock due to COVID for quite some time.

[Reddit - Mechanical Keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) -
A best place if you want to assemble your own keyboard. Not for the purchasers.

There are other places as Amazon, AliExpress etc, but I don't recommend due to
the higher prices because of custom duty imports.

Collecting and trying out various keyboards is slowly becoming one of my hobbies
though a very expensive one :)
