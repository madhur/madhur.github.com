SharePoint 2010 introduces a new object model to access sharepoint data on the client side which is the client [Client Object model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/gg620623)

Developers writing client applications have been getting confused as to which is to be used when.

I asked the question on [http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com](http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com) and got many replies

[WebServices or Client object model?](http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/26093/webservices-or-client-object-model)

The most upvoted answer gives the preference to using Client object model over web services whenever possible.

Recently, the auther of [SPServices](http://spservices.codeplex.com/) library - Marc Anderson also wrote an article covering the same topic. You can read the article [here](http://sympmarc.com/2012/04/12/when-to-choose-spservices-vs-the-client-side-object-model-csom/#comment-23489)
