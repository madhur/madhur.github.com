My location tracking app Hermes has been removed from Play Store by Google. This is the email which I got.

Essentially, the donate to paypal option is what rankled Google, since they were not getting their share. I wanted to simply repost the app with that option removed, but google doesn't leave with me with that choice, instead they wanted to upload the app with new package name which is quite a work. 

At this point, I have no plans of releasing Hermes again. I plan to develop a completely new version of Hermes with a public API and which will not depend upon SMS service.
