Saw, this [post](http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Microsoft-RVW1366630.htm) on Glassdoor. Being an ex-MS, I wonder what's slowly happening to this great company.

> The most uncollaborative work environment on the planet - the only way to move forward is to stab your neighbor in the back. The culture here actually encourages self-promotion and to tear down others. 
> Ironically they spend  millions on programs to appear as if this is not the case - then reviews come, and its Social Darwinism in its pure form - the only thing I have not seen first hand, is for a VP to eat their young. 
> I cannot wait to get out of here - and I am actually doing well in terms of reviews and bonus - but life is too short to move a career forward at this expense level. 
> I suspect those who love this enviroment have not been here long enough to realize that for them to move forward - they will need to leave a wake of bodies in their path - which is not for everyone.
