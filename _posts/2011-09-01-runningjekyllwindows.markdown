Update: If you would like to directly download the portable version of Jekyll. See my <a href="/blog/2013/07/20/buildportablejekyll.html">new blog post here</a>
</div>

Jekyll can also be made to run on Windows Operating System. This prefer when I am working on my office laptop which has Windows 7 installed on it.

Following packages are required to setup Jekyll on Windows:

* Ruby & Ruby Development Kit : Can be installed from [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
* Jekyll
* Python : I strongly recommend using 2.7.5 as opposed to version 3. I used the portable version available [here](http://portablepython.com/wiki/PortablePython2.7.5.1/)
* Pygments



**1** Install the Ruby from [http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and install it to path such as C:\ruby

**2** Download "DEVELOPMENT KIT" installer that matches the Windows architecture and the Ruby version just installed. For example, DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe is for 64-bit Windows   with Ruby 2.0.0 x64. 
Install the Ruby development kit from  [the same location above](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and extract it to path such as c:\devkit.

Run the following commands 

{% highlight text %}
ruby dk.rb init
{% endhighlight %}
	
   to generate the config.yml file to be used later in this Step
	
**3** Edit the generated config.yml file to include installed Rubies. For example, in our case, it will look like this

{% highlight text %}
# This configuration file contains the absolute path locations of all
# installed Rubies to be enhanced to work with the DevKit. This config
# file is generated by the 'ruby dk.rb init' step and may be modified
# before running the 'ruby dk.rb install' step. To include any installed
# Rubies that were not automagically discovered, simply add a line below
# the triple hyphens with the absolute path to the Ruby root directory.
#
# Example:
#
# ---
# - C:/ruby19trunk
# - C:/ruby192dev
#
---
- C:/ruby

{% endhighlight %}
	
**4** Run the following command to install to DevKit enhance your installed Rubies. This step installs (or updates) an operating_system.rb file into the relevant 
   directory needed to implement a RubyGems
   
   
{% highlight text %}
ruby dk.rb install
{% endhighlight %}
	
**5**	Install Jekyll using following command
{% highlight text %}
gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}
	
**6** Now, you can start using Jekyll. If you require code highlighting using pygments as well, follow the additional steps as well.

**7** Now we need to install, easy_install. This can be installed from [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#windows)
Download distribute_setup.py and run the following command in python

{% highlight text %}
python distribute_setup.py
{% endhighlight %}

**8** Now to install pygments, simply run this command:

Note that using Pygments version 0.5.0 is highly recommended. Latest version of Pygmnents has issues with Jekyll.

{% highlight text %}
easy_install Pygments 	
{% endhighlight %}

**9** Start Jekyll

Following the commands on official Jekyll Quick-start guide, a new Jekyll blog should be able to be created and browsed at localhost:4000.

{% highlight text %}
jekyll new myblog
cd myblog
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

Now browse to http://localhost:4000

#Troubleshooting#

##Liquid error: Bad file descriptor##

You are likely to hit this error if you are using Python version >3 as opposed to 2.7.5 as mentioned in the beginning

{% highlight text %}
Liquid error: Bad file descriptor
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
TypeError: Can't convert 'bytes' object to str implicitly
{% endhighlight %}

These are known issues and the resolution has been discussed here:
https://github.com/rtomayko/posix-spawn/issues/17

This requires a change in C:\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\albino-1.3.3\lib\albino.rb file.

I have created the gist of the changes required [here](https://gist.github.com/1185645)


## Build Failed ##

This will occur if Pygments is not installed. In that case, edit the \_config.yml and Change 'pygments: true' to 'pygments: false'

##Pygments not working ##

{% highlight text %}
gem uninstall pygments.rb --version "=0.5.2"  ; or whatever version you got installed
gem install pygments.rb --version "=0.5.0"
{% endhighlight %}

##Failed to build gem native extension. or  "python" is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. ##

"python" here can also be "ruby", "gem" or "easy_install", etc.

One of the reason of this error could be that your Ruby Dev kit binaries are not in PATH. Make sure that C:\devkit or whatever path you installed Ruby Development kit to is in path.

I make sure all the binaries of Ruby, Ruby Dev kit, Python are in path.

{% highlight text %}
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\ruby\bin;C:\devkit\bin;C:\git\bin;C:\Python\App;C:\devkit\mingw\bin
{% endhighlight %}

In Windows, you can also set PATH permanently by following the steps below

1. Hold Win and press Pause.
2. Click Advanced System Settings.
3. Click Environment Variables.
4. Append ;C:\python27 to the Path variable.
5. Restart Command Prompt.

##If you get the following error with the --watch option##

{% highlight text %}
C:/Ruby193/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/listen-1.3.1/lib/listen/adapter.rb:207:in `require': cannot load such file -- wdm (LoadError)
{% endhighlight %}

To fix that error, open the gemfile in your jekyll project directory and add these two lines:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'rbconfig'
gem 'wdm', '>= 0.1.0' if RbConfig::CONFIG['target_os'] =~ /mswin|mingw/i
{% endhighlight %}

##UTF-8 breaks on windows##
UTF-8 files have sometimes problems on Windows. To fix this error, either have your files in non-UTF-8 format or specify `RedCarpet` as your Markdown engine in `_config.yml`

{% highlight text %}
# GitHub Defaults
lsi: false
pygments: true
safe: true

# UTF-8 & parse errors fix
markdown: redcarpet
{% endhighlight %}
