About myself
======
I am a programmer/technology guy. I like building web applications using all the standard technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, ASP.NET, and SQL Server. 
I also know a good variety of programming languages too. .NET C# is my favourite, I know Java very well, and I know Javascript pretty well too.
I've been experimenting with Backtrack Linux in the last few months, using all the security tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, Metaspoilt, Sqlmap, Kismet, Ettercap etc.
I am also fairly proficient in using tools such as WinDbg, gdb, Ollydbg and IDA Pro for reverse engineering and debugging.
For operating systems I have experience in both Linux and Windows, Linux being my current operating system. 
I also have experience developing applications for Android.

Before entering the professional world, I spent some of the most fruitful years of my life studying Information Technology at [Bharati Vidyapeeth's](http://www.bharatividyapeeth.edu/default.aspx) [College of Engineering](http://www.bvucoepune.edu.in/), Pune. 
My interest in computers, internet and Linux dates back to 1997, when I was first introduced to a computer. That computer (Intel Pentium 120 MHz, 1.2GB HDD, 8MB RAM) was one of the most awesome things I had ever possessed.

(The syntax-highlighting, is generated by [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).
I push all of these out to my [GitHub repository](http://github.com/madhur/madhur.github.com/) using the version control system [git](http://git-scm.com/).
